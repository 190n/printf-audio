# printf-audio

Unwise use of glibc features to let you play audio using `printf`. Currently only supports Ogg Vorbis files. Uses [miniaudio](https://miniaud.io/) and [stb_vorbis](https://github.com/nothings/stb/).

To build, clone this repo with submodules and run `make`. Then run the `printf-audio` executable.
